    <h1 class="title">The smartwatches that can predict Parkinson's disease</h1>
    <img src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/1376xn/p0k06p8g.jpg.webp" class="hinh" alt=""> <br><br>

    <p class="text">       
        Smartwatches gather vast amounts of data about our physiology. Now their technology is being harnessed like never before.

        As the chief anaesthesiologist at CHUV University Hospital, Patrick Schoettker is all too aware of the complications which can follow a lengthy operation under general anaesthetic.
        Rapid blood loss from the surgical site can send the patient into shock, triggering sudden and dangerous dips in blood flow through the body. But patients can also develop severe lung problems after many hours of deep sedation, a complication which accounts for a quarter of all deaths within the first six days of surgery.
        Such tragedies sometimes occur due to underlying frailties in the patient's physiology which had gone undetected. But what if hospitals had a quick, low-cost way of screening for them ahead of major procedures? 
        Schoettker and his colleagues are conducting a trial which involves fitting patients with a smartwatch known as the Masimo W1 several weeks ahead of their pre-operation consultation. The data it has collected is then used to form an assessment of their state of health.
        The W1 provides continuous readings of heart rate, respiration rate, blood oxygen, pulse rate and even hydration levels, all to medical-grade accuracy. Schoettker describes the layers of information as being akin to a "digital twin", and believes it could help save lives.
        "We plan to use this pre-operatively acquired data to predict possible pre or postoperative complications and act on them in a preventative way," says Schoettker. 
        This is just one example of how the booming smartwatch market – some analysts have predicted that more than 400 million devices will be sold worldwide by 2027 – is opening up a bold new era of preventative health. Masimo, Apple, Samsung, Withings, FitBit and Polar have all developed watches capable of recording an extraordinary amount of data, allowing measurements such as sleep quality, blood pressure, heart rhythm variation and blood oxygen saturation levels – a marker of how well the heart and lungs are functioning – to be tracked in real-time. Gosia Wamil, a consultant cardiologist at Mayo Clinic Healthcare in London, says that this information is already helping to alert doctors to potential health problems, enabling them to act sooner.
        "More and more patients are willing to use their smartwatches to acquire some data, and then bring the printouts and results to us," says Wamil. "And then we can investigate further and confirm those abnormalities."
        So far, some of the biggest applications have been related to heart health. In April this year, one study found that smartwatch-acquired electrocardiogram (ECG) measurements – readings of the heart's electrical activity – could reliably identify extra heart beats in otherwise healthy 50 to 70 year olds. This can be a warning sign of a much more serious condition, atrial fibrillation, where the heart starts beating irregularly or accelerating out of control without warning.
        Other research has found that AI algorithms can use Apple Watch ECG readings to identify people with a low ejection fraction – the amount of blood that your heart pumps each time it beats, which can be a key warning sign of heart failure – with 88% accuracy. Wamil says that this combination of machine learning platforms and smartwatch-derived data is likely to prove revolutionary for patients with all kinds of heart conditions.
        "In cardiology clinics, we see patients who complain of palpitations, and we used to have those tapes which we could stick on their chest and record their ECG over 24 hours," says Wamil. "Very frequently, patients may not have symptoms during those 24 hours. But with smartwatches, whenever the patient experiences symptoms, they can press a button on their watch, acquire an ECG and show that to us."
        Wamil says this is already leading to preventative treatment, enabling cardiologists to prescribe blood thinner tablets to patients with signs of an irregular heartbeat, to help prevent strokes. She is also interested in whether this data can be used to prevent some of the cardiovascular complications experienced by many type 2 diabetes patients. "The reason why people with diabetes have shorter lives is because they are much more at risk of developing heart problems," says Wamil. "We hope that in the future, this data could be used to detect early signs to alert the patient and doctor about their future risk of heart attacks and strokes."
